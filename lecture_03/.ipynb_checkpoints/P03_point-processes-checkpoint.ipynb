    "Let us assume we have a process in which the probability of a given event, $p$, is small but we perform a large number of trials $N$. We further assume that the so-called rate of this process (or mean number of ocurring events), $\\lambda=Np$, is finite and constant. Then the probability of $k$ events occurring follows a Poisson distribution given by $$P(k|\\lambda)=\\frac{\\lambda^k e^{-\\lambda}}{k!}.$$ So the Poisson distribution describes the distributions of events, where each single one is rare but we perform a large number of trials in order to keep $\\lambda$ constant. An example for this is the number of photons reaching a telescope.\n",
