If you want to have it in another directory please change the current directory in the file browser (see Sec. 1.1) before you create the notebook or if already created use the right mouse click for opening the context menu. You can use first *Cut* the file then *Paste* the file in the correct directory. \n",

    "### 2.3 Writing a notebook \n",
    "\n",
    "After we have created an empty notebook we can write some content into the notebook.  The complete notebook is arranged by so called cells which are stacked on top of each other. The cells can have different types. The important types are *code cells* and *markdown cells*. In *code cells* you can write your program code which can be executed by an interpreter running in the background which is called *kernel*. In this example the only kernel available is a *Python* kernel. In other configurations there are also *bash*, *Julia*, *C++* kernels available. *Markdown cells* are typically used to write static content e.g. code documentation, exercise descriptions, images etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this example we write some python code into the first cell:\n",
    "\n",
    "![editnotebook](figs/editnotebook.png)\n",

    "\n",
    "![runprogram](figs/runprogram.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "After any execution, the notebook editor will create a new empty cell and the type of this cell will be *code*. Now we want to change the type of the cell into a *markdown documentation* cell. Therefore click on the code menu of the editor:\n",
    "\n",
    "![markdown](figs/markdown.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose *Markdown* to change the type of the cell:\n",
    "\n",
    "![celltype](figs/celltype.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now the layout of the cell slightly changes and you can type some content. Markdown commands are described in Sect. 6.  One interesting feature of such a markdown cell is that you can use $\\LaTeX$ commands e.g. equations which are displayed similar to any $\\LaTeX$ documents:\n",
    "\n",
    "![markdown1](figs/markdown1.png) \n",

    "If you execute the cell with *Shift-Enter*, you will see the Text of the cell now rendered:\n",
    "\n",
    "![markdown2](figs/markdown2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "To update existing cells in the notebook, you simply double click with your mouse on a cell and you are back in the edit mode. You can also change the type of the cell in the case that you started with a code cell and wanted to write some documentation. \n",
    "\n",
    "In any case after you've written content to the notebook you should save the complete notebook with the typical Save-Command *cmd-S* (MacOS), *Ctrl-S* (Linux, Windows?). You can also use the main menu which has all the necessary entries of a standard editor you probably know. \n",

    "### 2.4 The Run cell menu\n",

With this function you can download any file that is shown in the file browser. For uploading files you can use the *Upload* button (see Sect. 1.5). All uploaded files will be stored in the current working directory of the file browser. If you are using the right mouse button on an empty region of the file browser you will get an additional context menu with a *Download current folder as an archive* entry.

As long as the browser window is open and you're connected to the internet you will be logged in. In any other case your session will automatically be closed by the server.\n",
